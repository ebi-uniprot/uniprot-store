Q8GUJ2	ORCID	31953391	0000-0003-4604-7974	[Function][Subcellular Location][Expression]Protein/gene_name: PDLP5. Comments: PDLP5 is expressed in a spatiotemporal manner in the root during lateral root development. PDLP5 is expressed in cells overlying nascent lateral root primordial and is required to modulate the rate of lateral root emergence by creating a symphonic domain in overlying cells. PDLP5 expression in roots is controlled by auxin and the expression of PDLP5 or PDLP5- induced plasmodesmal closure feedback regulates auxin signaling necessary for the lateral root emergence process.
